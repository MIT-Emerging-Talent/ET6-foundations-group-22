# Constraints

To ensure efficiency and balanced contributions, the project should have clear boundaries.
Roles and responsibilities should be well-defined to prevent overlapping efforts,
with expectations set for balanced contributions considering each member’s constraints.

A culture of constructive feedback and solution-focused discussions should be established,
with a clear process in place for resolving conflicts.
These boundaries aim to create a productive and supportive environment for the team.

## External Constraints

The team faces several external constraints impacting collaboration.
Remote work across different timezones can be challenging.
Limited or unstable internet access complicates communication and online collaboration.
Some team members are constrained by family and work responsibilities,
while others face time limitations due to university final exams.

## Internal Involuntary Constraints

The team faces several internal involuntary constraints that affect their progress.
Many members lack prior knowledge or experience with Git and GitHub.
Limited technical expertise, combined with the new skills required are constraining.
Balancing professional commitments and personal responsibilities, limits availability.
These factors create hurdles in both skill development and team collaboration.

## Internal Voluntary Constraints

Members commit to providing daily progress updates and adhering to group norms.
There is a collective agreement to focus on medium-level coding challenges
that match everyone’s skill level,
allowing for skill development while gaining confidence in using Git and GitHub.
Balancing project work with other commitments is emphasized,
along with maintaining discipline in following the project plan.
To accommodate time constraints and differing availability, the team prioritizes
asynchronous communication methods, such as using GitHub issues and pull requests.
These guidelines aim to promote effective teamwork and steady progress.
