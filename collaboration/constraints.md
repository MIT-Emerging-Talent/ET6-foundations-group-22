# ⚙️ **Project Boundaries & Constraints**

## 🚧 **Clear Boundaries for Efficiency**

To ensure efficiency and balanced contributions, the project should have clear boundaries.

Roles and responsibilities should be **well-defined** to prevent overlapping efforts.

Expectations should be set for balanced contributions,
considering each member’s constraints.

A **culture of constructive feedback** and solution-focused discussions should
be established.

Moreover, a **clear process** for resolving conflicts is essential.

------------------------------

These boundaries aim to create a productive and supportive environment for our team.

## 🌍 **External Constraints**

Our team faces several external constraints impacting collaboration:

- **🌍 Timezones**: Remote work across different timezones can be challenging.  
- **🌐 Internet Access**: Limited or unstable internet access complicates
communication and online collaboration.  
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family & Work**: Some members are constrained by family and work
responsibilities.  
- **📚 Academic Commitments**: Others face time limitations due to university
final exams.

## ⚙️ **Internal Involuntary Constraints**

Our team faces several **internal involuntary constraints** that affect the progress:

- **📂 Git & GitHub Knowledge**: Many members lack prior knowledge or experience
with Git and GitHub.  
- **🛠️ Technical Expertise**: Limited technical expertise, combined with new
skills required, is a challenge to our team members.  
- **⏳ Time Availability**: Balancing professional commitments and personal
responsibilities limits availability.  

These factors create hurdles in both **skill development** and **team collaboration**.

## 🛠️ **Internal Voluntary Constraints**

Members commit to the following **voluntary constraints** to ensure steady progress:

- **📝 Daily Progress Updates**:
Members will provide daily updates on their
progress.  
- **💻 Medium-level Coding Challenges**:
 We will focus on coding challenges that
 match everyone’s skill level to promote learning.  
- **⚖️ Balancing Commitments**:
 We will prioritize a balance between project work
and other commitments.  
- **📬 Asynchronous Communication**:
Emphasis on using asynchronous methods
like GitHub issues and pull requests.

These guidelines aim to foster effective teamwork, **skill development**, and
steady project progress.
