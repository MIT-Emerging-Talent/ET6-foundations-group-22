# Retrospective

# Introduction

As our project comes to an end, we’re taking a moment to reflect on everything
we’ve learned along the way 🎉
From the things we could’ve done better to the strategies that worked like a charm,
this journey has been full of lots of lessons 🤓.

In this summary, we’ll dive into what we need to *stop*,
*continue*, and *start* doing, share some cool takeaways,
and compare how our initial plans stacked up against reality 📊
Here’s what we’ve learned and how we’re planning to level up
for the next project 🚀!

## Stop Doing

### Mistakes Made  

- 🕒 Time Management:  
  - Spending too much time organizing synchronous meetings instead of working asynchronously.
  - Poor prioritization strategies and leaving most work for the last days.  
- 🔄 Missed Steps:  
  - Lack of early starts to provide opportunities for better knowledge sharing.
  - No clear process for reassigning reviews if someone was unavailable.  
  - The review process took longer than expected and needed better management.
- 🗨️ Communication Issues:  
  - Lack of asynchronous protocols like setting response times and deadlines
  - Insufficient regular and short catch-up meetings.  
  - No specific roles defined for team members, such as a team leader for task assignment.

## Continue Doing

### Successes to Maintain  

- 🛠️ Tools and Practices:  
  - Effective use of Slack for communication and GitHub project boards for organization.
  - Recording meetings for those unable to attend.  
  - Structured code review through GitHub pull request features.  
- 🤝 Supportive Culture:  
  - Team members were supportive, helping each other with questions or issues.  
  - One-on-one quick meetings scheduled to resolve individual issues.
